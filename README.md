## 🌟 Core Features Overview

### 🎨 User Experience First
- **Premium Glassmorphism Design**: A modern, translucent UI that builds trust and engagement.
- **Mobile-First Architecture**: Fully responsive web app that behaves natively on iOS/Android.
- **130+ Language Support**: Powered by Google Translate API with intelligent caching. **Complete translation coverage**: UI strings, service categories, status labels, filter buttons, priority levels, search placeholders, and user-submitted content are automatically translated. **Automatic notification translation**: All confirmation emails and SMS messages are sent in the resident's selected language—no additional configuration needed.
- **No-Login Submission**: Removes friction for residents while maintaining security via email magic links.

### 🧠 Advanced Intelligence
- **Information Redaction**: Automatically strips PII (names, phones, emails) from public request logs.
- **Visual Analysis**: Uses **Gemini 3.0 Flash** via Google Cloud **Vertex AI** to "see" uploaded photos and categorize hazards (e.g., "pothole caused by water damage").
- **Multilingual AI Analysis**: When residents submit requests in non-English languages, the AI automatically provides a literal English translation first before performing its analysis, ensuring staff can understand all submissions regardless of language.
- **Priority Scoring (Human-in-the-Loop)**: AI suggests a 1-10 urgency score, but scores are **never automatically saved**. Staff must explicitly accept or override the AI suggestion, ensuring human accountability for all priority decisions.

### 🗺️ Geospatial Power
- **Asset Matching**: snaps user pins to verified infrastructure (e.g., streetlights, hydrants) using PostGIS `ST_DWithin`.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Validates that requests are actually within township limits before submission.
- **Heatmaps & Clustering**: Auto-groups nearby requests to visualize problem hotspots.

---

## 🏠 Resident Portal Features

The Resident Portal is the public face of the system, designed for zero friction.

### 1. Service Discovery
- **Visual Grid**: Services are displayed with clear, consistent iconography (Lucide React) for instant recognition.
- **Service Categories**: Browsable catalog of all available township services.

### 2. Intelligent Location Picker
- **Interactive Map**: Google Maps integration with drag-to-set pin functionality.
- **Address Autocomplete**: Type-ahead search for local addresses.
- **Jurisdiction Boundaries**: System-level polygons (GeoJSON) define the valid service area. PINS dropped outside are auto-rejected.
- **Asset Integration**: Requests can be linked to specific infrastructure assets (e.g., specific park zones) if configured.

### 3. Advanced Routing Logic
- **Road-Based Routing**: Configurable rules for state/county roads.
    - *Example*: Potholes on "Route 1" are automatically blocked with a custom message: "This road is maintained by the State DOT. Please call 555-0199."
- **Third-Party Hand-off**: Services managed by private contractors (e.g., Waste Management) show specific contact info instead of a generic form.

### 4. Submission & Tracking
- **Multi-Photo Upload**: Supports up to 3 high-res images with client-side compression.
- **Magic Link Tracking**: Users receive a unique, hash-based tracking link (e.g., `/track/req-123`) to view live status updates without creating an account.
- **Status Timeline**: clean visualization of the request journey from "Received" → "In Progress" → "Resolved" → "Closed".
- **Public Request Map**: Interactive map allowing residents to view all open and resolved requests. Features robust filtering by:
    - **Department** (Police, Public Works, etc.)
    - **Status** (Open, Closed, In Progress)
    - **Date Range**
    - **Service Type**

---

## 👷 Staff Dashboard Features

The Staff Dashboard is the command center for municipal operations, protected by secure JWT authentication.

### 1. Unified Workspace
- **Live Feed**: Auto-refreshes every 30s; identifying "NEW" requests with badging.
- **Split-Pane View**: Independent scrolling for the request list and details panel.
- **Interactive Map**: Features "Satellite View" for precise location verification. Includes comprehensive filters for:
    - **Priority Level** (Critical, High, Normal)
    - **Department & Assigned Staff**
    - **Status & Date Range**
    - **Service Category**

### 2. Collaboration Tools
- **Internal Comments**: Private staff-only notes for coordination.
- **External Updates**: Public comments visible to residents via the tracker.
- **Staff Preferences**: Each staff member can toggle their own SMS/Email notifications.
- **Audit Log**: Immutable history of every action (status change, assignment, comment).

### 3. Request Management
- **Smart Assignment**: Auto-route to specific departments or keep in a general queue.
- **Completion Types**: Close requests as **Resolved** (with photo proof), **No Action Needed** (invalid), or **Transferred** (third-party).
- **Priority Override**: Manually escalate issues that AI might have missed.
- **Asset History**: When viewing a request attached to a physical asset (e.g., Hydrant #404), automatically shows all past history for that specific asset.
- **Status Workflow**:
    - **Open**: New request.
    - **In Progress**: Staff acknowledged and working.
    - **Resolved**: Work complete.
    - **Closed**: Final state (includes optional "Completion Photo" proof).

### 4. AI Insights Panel (Vertex AI Powered)
- **Safety Flags**: Highlights potential liabilities (e.g., "Downed power line detected").
- **Proximity Analysis**: Checks if the issue is near critical infrastructure (Schools, Hospitals, Fire Stations) via PostGIS, with a **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)** fallback for unmapped areas.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauges the tone of the resident's description (Neutral, Frustrated, Urgent).
- **Weather Context**: Automatically fetches real-time weather (e.g., "Heavy Rain, 45°F") to validiate hazards.
- **Gemini 3.0 Flash**: Powered by Google's latest model with "Thinking Config" for deep reasoning and lower latency.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Suggests potential duplicate reports based on location (within 50m) and time window.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Priority**: AI priority suggestions are stored in a JSON field and displayed with an **"Accept AI Priority"** button. Staff must explicitly accept the score before it becomes the official priority, creating a complete audit trail.
- **PostGIS Geospatial Analytics**:
    - **Hotspot Analysis**: Automatically clusters requests to identify problem areas (e.g., "Pothole Clusters" on specific roads).
    - **User Bias Detection**: Flags suspicious activity using spatial statistics (e.g., single user spamming requests in a 10m radius).
    - **Jurisdiction Verification**: Real-time point-in-polygon checks against township boundaries.

---

## ⚙️ Admin Console Features

A full CMS for managing the municipality's presence without touching code.

- **Custom Icons**: Select from a library of 100+ icons.
- **Routing Rules**: Assign services to specific departments (e.g., "Potholes" → "DPW").
- **SLA Definitions**: Set expected response times (e.g., "24 hours" for urgent issues).

### 1. Service Configuration
- **Granular Routing**: Configure each service category (e.g., "Pothole") to:
    - **Township Handled**: Route to internal Public Works department.
    - **Third-Party Handoff**: Direct residents to external agencies (e.g., "This road is state-maintained, please call DOT at...").
    - **Road-Based Logic**: Automatically split jurisdiction based on specific street names (e.g., "Main St" goes to County, "Elm St" stays local).
- **Custom Questions**: specific follow-up questions (e.g., "Is the dog aggressive?") for each service category to gather precise details.

### 2. System Management
- **System Updates**: One-click "Pull Updates" to fetch the latest code from GitHub and rebuild containers.
- **Custom Map Layers**: Upload **GeoJSON** files to visualize township assets (Parks, Storm Drains, Zoning Districts) directly on the staff map.
- **Domain Configuration**: Automatic HTTPS provisioning via Caddy (Let's Encrypt) for custom domains.
- **Key Management**: Securely store API keys for Google Maps, Vertex AI (Google Cloud Project ID + Service Account Key), and SMS Providers.
- **Feature Modules**: Toggle major features like "AI Analysis" or "SMS Alerts" on/off globally.
    - `ENABLE_SMS_ALERTS`: Toggle text message notifications (Twilio or Generic).
- **Database Maintenance**: Tools to seed default data or flush test records.

### 3. Legal Documents & Compliance
Fully customizable legal pages with sensible defaults based on municipal 311 best practices:

- **Privacy Policy**: Customizable Markdown content explaining data collection, usage, and retention. Default covers:
  - What information is collected (email required, optional phone)
  - How data is used (service request processing and communication)
  - Data sharing with relevant departments and third parties
  - Resident rights (access, correction, deletion)
  
- **Terms of Service**: Customizable Markdown with prominent non-emergency disclaimer. Default emphasizes:
  - Non-emergency use only (911 for emergencies)

## ⚠️ Non-Emergency Disclaimer System

Built-in legal protection ensuring residents understand 311 is for non-emergency municipal services only.

### One-Time Acknowledgment Modal
- **Premium Design**: Glassmorphism modal matching portal aesthetic
- **Checkbox Confirmation**: Users must actively acknowledge before accessing portal
- **Emergency Examples**: Lists when to call 911 (medical, fire, crimes, threats, downed lines)
- **localStorage Persistence**: Shows once per browser, doesn't repeatedly annoy returning users

### Persistent Warning Banner
- **Always Visible**: Amber gradient banner at top of resident portal
- **Clear Messaging**: "**Non-Emergency Only** — For police, fire, or medical emergencies, call **911**"

### Legal Audit Logging
Every acknowledgment is logged to the `disclaimer_acknowledgments` table:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_id` | Unique browser session identifier |
| `ip_address` | Client IP (supports IPv4/IPv6, handles proxies) |
| `user_agent` | Browser/device information |
| `acknowledged_at` | Timestamp with timezone |
| `disclaimer_version` | Version string for tracking policy updates |

This creates a complete paper trail for legal protection if any user claims they weren't aware of the non-emergency nature of the service.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture

### Communication Engine
- **Branding Engine**: Automatically injects township logo, colors, and font settings into every email.
- **Rich SMS**: Sends text alerts with status emojis (✅, 🚧), request details (category, address), and magic links for instant tracking.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Built-in support for **Twilio**, plus a generic HTTP adapter for any other SMS gateway.
- **Completion Proof**: "Review & Close" workflow attaches the final resolution photo to the closing email sent to the resident.

### Standards Compliance
- **Open311 v2**: Fully compliant with the Open311 GeoReport v2 standard (JSON).
    - `GET /requests.json`: Public feed (cached via Redis).
    - `POST /requests.json`: Standard submission endpoint.
- **Audit Trails**: Every action (submission, comment, status change) is logged for accountability.

### Tech Stack
| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript | Performant, type-safe UI built with Vite |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion | Fluid animations and glassmorphism themes |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python 3.11) | High-performance async REST API |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS | Relational data with advanced spatial queries |
| **Migrations** | Alembic | Version-controlled database schema changes |
| **Caching** | Redis | High-speed caching for public request feeds (60s TTL) |
| **AI** | Vertex AI (Gemini Flash) | Multimodal model for image/text analysis |
| **Queue** | Celery + Redis | Background processing for emails and reports |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Caddy | Automatic HTTPS and SSL termination |

### 🗄️ Database Migrations (Alembic)

Pinpoint 311 uses **Alembic** for database schema versioning:

```bash
# Inside the backend container
cd /app

# Create a new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new column to requests"

# Apply pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# View current migration state
alembic current
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- PostGIS/Tiger geocoder tables are **excluded** from autogenerate to prevent false positives
- Migrations are stored in `backend/alembic/versions/`
- Use `alembic stamp head` to mark an existing database as up-to-date without running migrations

### 🔒 Security Standards

#### Enterprise Security Stack
Pinpoint 311 implements a production-grade security stack with managed cloud services:

| Component | Purpose | Provider |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Auth0** | SSO with MFA & Passkeys | Managed Identity |
| **Google Secret Manager** | API keys & credentials | Google Cloud |
| **Google Cloud KMS** | Resident PII encryption | Google Cloud |
| **Watchtower** | Container auto-updates | Self-hosted |

#### Zero-Password Authentication
Staff login via **Auth0** with enterprise-grade security:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP, passkeys, and biometric support
- **Social Login**: Google, Microsoft, and other identity providers
- **Passwordless Option**: WebAuthn/passkeys for phishing resistance
- **No passwords stored**: Authentication fully delegated to Auth0

#### Secrets Management
Two-tier security for credentials:

| Secret Type | Storage | Encryption |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| API Keys (SMTP, SMS, Maps) | Google Secret Manager | Google-managed HSMs |
| Resident PII (email, phone, name) | PostgreSQL | Google Cloud KMS (AES-256) |
| Local Development | Encrypted Database | Fernet (AES-128-CBC) |


#### GCP Service Account Authentication
Pinpoint 311 uses **encrypted service account keys** for Google Cloud access:

```
┌─────────────┐    Fernet Encrypted    ┌──────────────────┐    Direct Auth    ┌─────────────┐
│   Backend   │ ─────────────────────▶ │ PostgreSQL DB    │ ────────────────▶ │ GCP APIs    │
│   (FastAPI) │                        │ (system_secrets) │                   │ SM, KMS, AI │
└─────────────┘                        └──────────────────┘                   └─────────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. Upload service account JSON during initial setup
2. Key is encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC) using `SECRET_KEY`
3. Stored securely in the `system_secrets` database table
4. Decrypted at runtime when accessing GCP services

**Bootstrap Keys:**
Two keys must remain in the local database (not migrated to Secret Manager):
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: The encrypted service account key
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID

These "bootstrap keys" are needed to *access* Secret Manager itself, so they must be stored locally.


#### API & Infrastructure Security
- **Rate Limiting**: 500 requests/minute per IP (slowapi)
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, nosniff, XSS protection
- **RBAC**: Staff, Researcher, Admin roles with JWT authentication
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas, SQLAlchemy ORM (SQL injection proof)
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable trail of all request lifecycle events

For full security details, see [COMPLIANCE.md](./COMPLIANCE.md).

#### Vertex AI Security
| Feature | Protection |
|---------|------------|
| Data Residency | Stays within configured GCP region |
| Encryption | TLS 1.3+ in transit, AES-256 at rest |
| No Data Training | Customer data NOT used for training |
| Certifications | SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, HIPAA |
| Human-in-the-Loop | AI suggestions require staff approval |

### 📋 Document Retention Engine

State-specific record retention with legal hold protection:
- **Built-in policies**: TX (10yr), NJ/PA/WI (7yr), NY/MI/WA (6yr), CA/FL/others (3-5yr)
- **Admin-configurable**: Select state or custom period
- **Automatic enforcement**: Daily Celery task archives expired records

#### Legal Holds
When litigation or investigation is anticipated, records can be placed on **legal hold** to prevent automatic deletion:
- **Per-request holds**: Staff can flag individual requests as "Legal Hold" from the detail view
- **Bulk holds**: Admin can apply holds to all requests matching specific criteria (date range, category, location)
- **Hold expiration**: Optional expiration date, or indefinite hold until manually released
- **Audit trail**: All hold/release actions are logged with timestamp and user

#### Compliance Features
| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|

## 📦 Deployment & Setup

### CI/CD Pipeline

Pinpoint 311 uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and security scanning:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Build & Publish** | Push to main | Multi-arch Docker images to GHCR |
| **CodeQL** | Push/PR + weekly | Static security analysis (Python/JS) |
| **Security Scan** | Push + weekly | OWASP ZAP + Trivy vulnerability scanning |
| **Uptime Monitor** | Every 15 min | Health checks with auto-restart |
| **Dependabot** | Weekly | Automatic dependency updates |

### Self-Healing Infrastructure

The system automatically recovers from common failures without developer intervention:

| Layer | Protection | Config Required |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Docker Healthchecks** | Backend, Worker, Frontend auto-restart if unresponsive | None ✅ |
| **Container Restart** | Containers restart after crash (`unless-stopped`) | None ✅ |
| **Watchtower** | Auto-pulls security updates at 3am daily | None ✅ |
| **SSH Auto-Restart** | Force restart via SSH when uptime check fails | Optional* |

*To enable SSH auto-restart, add `PROD_HOST` and `PROD_SSH_KEY` secrets to your GitHub repository.

### Resource Isolation

Prevents the 311 system from affecting other server systems:

| Service | CPU | Memory | Log Limit |
|---------|-----|--------|-----------|
| Database | 1 core | 1GB | 150MB |
| Backend | 1 core | 1GB | 150MB |
| Worker | 0.5 core | 512MB | 60MB |
| Frontend | 0.5 core | 256MB | 30MB |
| Redis | 0.25 core | 256MB | 30MB |
| Caddy | 0.25 core | 128MB | 60MB |

**Safety features:** `no-new-privileges` on all containers, Redis memory eviction, process limits on database.

### Docker Images

Pre-built images available on GitHub Container Registry:
```bash
ghcr.io/westwindsorforward/wwf-311-backend:latest
ghcr.io/westwindsorforward/wwf-311-frontend:latest
```

Supports both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` architectures.

### Production Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull prebuilt images and deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Development Deployment

```bash
# Build locally (slower, for development only)
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- A Google Cloud Project (for Maps & Vertex AI)

### Quick Start (Using Prebuilt Images)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WestWindsorForward/WWF-Open-Source-311-Template.git
cd WWF-Open-Source-311-Template

# 2. Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your secrets (DB_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY, etc.)

# 3. Pull prebuilt images and launch (recommended - fastest)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# OR build locally (slower, for development/modifications)
# docker compose up --build -d
```

### Access Points
- **Resident Portal**: `http://localhost/`
- **Staff Dashboard**: `http://localhost/staff`
- **Admin Console**: `http://localhost/admin`
- **Research Lab**: `http://localhost/research` *(requires researcher role)*
- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost/api/docs`

### Initial Setup & Authentication

Pinpoint 311 uses **Auth0 SSO** for all staff authentication.

#### Step 1: Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   - DB_PASSWORD: Set a secure database password
#   - SECRET_KEY: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
#   - DOMAIN: Your production domain (e.g., 311.yourtown.gov)
```

#### Step 2: Start Services
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Step 3: Get Bootstrap Access
Before Auth0 is configured, use the bootstrap endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/auth/bootstrap
```
Click the returned magic link → logs you into Admin Console.

#### Step 4: Configure Auth0 via Setup Wizard
In Admin Console → Setup Wizard:
1. Enter Auth0 domain, client ID, client secret
2. System encrypts and stores credentials securely
3. Bootstrap access is automatically disabled

#### Step 5: (Optional) Enable Google Secret Manager
For enterprise-grade secret storage, configure GCP in the Setup Wizard. Secrets will be migrated from the database to Google Secret Manager.

### Security Storage

| Secret | Default Storage | Enterprise Storage |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| DB Password | `.env` file | `.env` file |
| JWT Secret Key | `.env` file | `.env` file |
| Auth0 Credentials | Database (Fernet encrypted) | Google Secret Manager |
| API Keys | Database (Fernet encrypted) | Google Secret Manager |

> [!NOTE]
> Bootstrap access is automatically disabled once Auth0 is configured. All future logins use SSO.
