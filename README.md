## 🌟 Core Features Overview

### 🎨 User Experience First
- **Premium Glassmorphism Design**: A modern, translucent UI that builds trust and engagement.
- **Mobile-First Architecture**: Fully responsive web app that behaves natively on iOS/Android.
- **130+ Language Support**: Powered by Google Translate API with intelligent caching. **Complete translation coverage**: UI strings, service categories, status labels, filter buttons, priority levels, search placeholders, and user-submitted content are automatically translated. **Automatic notification translation**: All confirmation emails and SMS messages are sent in the resident's selected language—no additional configuration needed.
- **No-Login Submission**: Removes friction for residents while maintaining security via email magic links.

### 🧠 Advanced Intelligence
- **Information Redaction**: Automatically strips PII (names, phones, emails) from public request logs.
- **Visual Analysis**: Uses **Gemini 3.0 Flash** via Google Cloud **Vertex AI** to "see" uploaded photos and categorize hazards (e.g., "pothole caused by water damage").
- **Multilingual AI Analysis**: When residents submit requests in non-English languages, the AI automatically provides a literal English translation first before performing its analysis, ensuring staff can understand all submissions regardless of language.
- **Priority Scoring (Human-in-the-Loop)**: AI suggests a 1-10 urgency score, but scores are **never automatically saved**. Staff must explicitly accept or override the AI suggestion, ensuring human accountability for all priority decisions.

### 🗺️ Geospatial Power
- **Asset Matching**: snaps user pins to verified infrastructure (e.g., streetlights, hydrants) using PostGIS `ST_DWithin`.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Validates that requests are actually within township limits before submission.
- **Heatmaps & Clustering**: Auto-groups nearby requests to visualize problem hotspots.

---

## 🏠 Resident Portal Features

The Resident Portal is the public face of the system, designed for zero friction.

### 1. Service Discovery
- **Visual Grid**: Services are displayed with clear, consistent iconography (Lucide React) for instant recognition.
- **Service Categories**: Browsable catalog of all available township services.

### 2. Intelligent Location Picker
- **Interactive Map**: Google Maps integration with drag-to-set pin functionality.
- **Address Autocomplete**: Type-ahead search for local addresses.
- **Jurisdiction Boundaries**: System-level polygons (GeoJSON) define the valid service area. PINS dropped outside are auto-rejected.
- **Asset Integration**: Requests can be linked to specific infrastructure assets (e.g., specific park zones) if configured.

### 3. Advanced Routing Logic
- **Road-Based Routing**: Configurable rules for state/county roads.
    - *Example*: Potholes on "Route 1" are automatically blocked with a custom message: "This road is maintained by the State DOT. Please call 555-0199."
- **Third-Party Hand-off**: Services managed by private contractors (e.g., Waste Management) show specific contact info instead of a generic form.

### 4. Submission & Tracking
- **Multi-Photo Upload**: Supports up to 3 high-res images with client-side compression.
- **Magic Link Tracking**: Users receive a unique, hash-based tracking link (e.g., `/track/req-123`) to view live status updates without creating an account.
- **Status Timeline**: clean visualization of the request journey from "Received" → "In Progress" → "Resolved" → "Closed".
- **Public Request Map**: Interactive map allowing residents to view all open and resolved requests. Features robust filtering by:
    - **Department** (Police, Public Works, etc.)
    - **Status** (Open, Closed, In Progress)
    - **Date Range**
    - **Service Type**

---

## 👷 Staff Dashboard Features

The Staff Dashboard is the command center for municipal operations, protected by secure JWT authentication.

### 1. Unified Workspace
- **Live Feed**: Auto-refreshes every 30s; identifying "NEW" requests with badging.
- **Split-Pane View**: Independent scrolling for the request list and details panel.
- **Interactive Map**: Features "Satellite View" for precise location verification. Includes comprehensive filters for:
    - **Priority Level** (Critical, High, Normal)
    - **Department & Assigned Staff**
    - **Status & Date Range**
    - **Service Category**

### 2. Collaboration Tools
- **Internal Comments**: Private staff-only notes for coordination.
- **External Updates**: Public comments visible to residents via the tracker.
- **Staff Preferences**: Each staff member can toggle their own SMS/Email notifications.
- **Audit Log**: Immutable history of every action (status change, assignment, comment).

### 3. Request Management
- **Smart Assignment**: Auto-route to specific departments or keep in a general queue.
- **Completion Types**: Close requests as **Resolved** (with photo proof), **No Action Needed** (invalid), or **Transferred** (third-party).
- **Priority Override**: Manually escalate issues that AI might have missed.
- **Asset History**: When viewing a request attached to a physical asset (e.g., Hydrant #404), automatically shows all past history for that specific asset.
- **Status Workflow**:
    - **Open**: New request.
    - **In Progress**: Staff acknowledged and working.
    - **Resolved**: Work complete.
    - **Closed**: Final state (includes optional "Completion Photo" proof).

### 4. AI Insights Panel (Vertex AI Powered)
- **Safety Flags**: Highlights potential liabilities (e.g., "Downed power line detected").
- **Proximity Analysis**: Checks if the issue is near critical infrastructure (Schools, Hospitals, Fire Stations) via PostGIS, with a **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)** fallback for unmapped areas.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauges the tone of the resident's description (Neutral, Frustrated, Urgent).
- **Weather Context**: Automatically fetches real-time weather (e.g., "Heavy Rain, 45°F") to validiate hazards.
- **Gemini 3.0 Flash**: Powered by Google's latest model with "Thinking Config" for deep reasoning and lower latency.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Suggests potential duplicate reports based on location (within 50m) and time window.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Priority**: AI priority suggestions are stored in a JSON field and displayed with an **"Accept AI Priority"** button. Staff must explicitly accept the score before it becomes the official priority, creating a complete audit trail.
- **PostGIS Geospatial Analytics**:
    - **Hotspot Analysis**: Automatically clusters requests to identify problem areas (e.g., "Pothole Clusters" on specific roads).
    - **User Bias Detection**: Flags suspicious activity using spatial statistics (e.g., single user spamming requests in a 10m radius).
    - **Jurisdiction Verification**: Real-time point-in-polygon checks against township boundaries.

---

## ⚙️ Admin Console Features

A full CMS for managing the municipality's presence without touching code.

- **Custom Icons**: Select from a library of 100+ icons.
- **Routing Rules**: Assign services to specific departments (e.g., "Potholes" → "DPW").
- **SLA Definitions**: Set expected response times (e.g., "24 hours" for urgent issues).

### 1. Service Configuration
- **Granular Routing**: Configure each service category (e.g., "Pothole") to:
    - **Township Handled**: Route to internal Public Works department.
    - **Third-Party Handoff**: Direct residents to external agencies (e.g., "This road is state-maintained, please call DOT at...").
    - **Road-Based Logic**: Automatically split jurisdiction based on specific street names (e.g., "Main St" goes to County, "Elm St" stays local).
- **Custom Questions**: specific follow-up questions (e.g., "Is the dog aggressive?") for each service category to gather precise details.

### 2. System Management
- **System Updates**: One-click "Pull Updates" to fetch the latest code from GitHub and rebuild containers.
- **Custom Map Layers**: Upload **GeoJSON** files to visualize township assets (Parks, Storm Drains, Zoning Districts) directly on the staff map.
- **Domain Configuration**: Automatic HTTPS provisioning via Caddy (Let's Encrypt) for custom domains.
- **Key Management**: Securely store API keys for Google Maps, Vertex AI (Google Cloud Project ID + Service Account Key), and SMS Providers.
- **Feature Modules**: Toggle major features like "AI Analysis" or "SMS Alerts" on/off globally.
    - `ENABLE_SMS_ALERTS`: Toggle text message notifications (Twilio or Generic).
- **Database Maintenance**: Tools to seed default data or flush test records.
